# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in helping to improve Conduit. This guide is here to keep contributions focused and to prevent wasted effort on things that are unlikely to be merged.

## PRs are likely to be merged if:

- They fix bugs, and include reproduction steps and testing notes in your PR description.
- If the PR is introducing a new feature, that feature has an associated issue where we have aligned on scope, UX and technical approach.
- They improve translations.

## PRs are unlikely to be merged if:

- They introduce new features without an associated issue where the feature has been scoped.
- They only change documentation, we welcome issues regarding insufficient documentation and will address these ourselves.

## Contributor license agreement

When submitting a pull request for the first time, you will need to agree to the contributor license agreement (for [individuals](./CLA-individual.md)). To do this, in the pull request please create a file with a name like `/contributors/{github_username}.md`, and in the content of that file indicate your agreement. An example of what that file should contain can be seen in [tmgrask's agreement file](./contributors/tmgrask.md).
